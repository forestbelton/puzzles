    <p>
      Welcome to my page of puzzle solvers and calculators! I have written these
      over the years and decided it would be better to compile them all in one
      place instead of creating a new web application every single time.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of the tools are listed on the left. Click on one and have fun! ðŸ¤“
